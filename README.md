The app will initially start with ten trails in Wyoming and display the template users will be able to follow, to share and upload their own trails/conditions report. App will launch specializing towards mountain bikers as trail conditions are very important to a successful ride. Users will be able to update the trail conditions with comments and timestamps based on a recent experience. The trails report will then be featured on the trail they wrote the report for. The app will have a homepage where users can view trails featured in the app, as well as sign in or sign up.
