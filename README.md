Trail conditions App

The trail conditions app is designed to be an online community and resource for all users. Users will be able to sign up/create an account to share information about their local trails and the conditions found on the trail. The app will initially start with ten trails in Wyoming and display the template users will be able to follow, to share and upload their own trails/conditions report. App will launch specializing towards mountain bikers as trail conditions are very important to a successful ride. Users will be able to update the trail conditions with comments and timestamps based on a recent experience. The trails report will then be featured in the userâ€™s personal account.
